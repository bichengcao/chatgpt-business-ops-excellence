# Organization of the Repository

The guides in this repository are organized to make it easy for you to find the information you need. We've broken down the guides into three main levels of organization:

1. **Business Size and Type**: We've divided the guides into broad categories based on the size and type of the business. This includes categories such as small business, medium-sized business, and large business, as well as more general categories like non-profit.

2. **Maturity Level**: Within each business size and type category, we've further divided the guides based on the maturity level of the business. This includes categories such as early-stage, growth, and mature.

3. **Functions or Steps**: Within each maturity level category, we've organized the guides based on the specific functions or steps involved in business operations. This includes categories such as finance, marketing, and human resources.

4. **Industry or Business model specific**: We've also added sub-folders for any industry or business model specific details, so you can find the information that is specific to your needs.

By organizing the guides in this way, we hope to make it easy for you to find the information you need, regardless of the size and type of your business or its maturity level. If you have any questions or suggestions for how we can improve the organization of the guides, please feel free to reach out to us.
